# Rules of the Game

This is a simulation of a "simple" game written in JavaScript. The idea is to let students watch several rounds of the game to formulate rules (can players jump over other pieces? can players move diagonally? how do players win? etc.) similar to how scientists make hypotheses by observing how the universe works.
